### Vision
As large models are released and iterated upon, they are becoming increasingly intelligent. However, in the process of using large models, we face significant challenges in data security and privacy. We need to ensure that our sensitive data and environments remain completely controlled and avoid any data privacy leaks or security risks. Based on this, we have launched the DB-GPT project to build a complete private large model solution for all database-based scenarios. This solution supports local deployment, allowing it to be applied not only in independent private environments but also to be independently deployed and isolated according to business modules, ensuring that the ability of large models is absolutely private, secure, and controllable.

With this solution, you can be assured that there is no risk of data leakage, and your data is 100% private and secure.

### About us
We are a group of open source technology enthusiasts from internet companies and some NLP graduate students.

In the era of large models, we have personally experienced the power of open source and believe that many technologies will become the infrastructure of the new era, such as the ability of large models, LLMOps-related frameworks, Text2SQL accuracy, etc. 

We also hope to contribute to the development of the new era through this open source organization.
