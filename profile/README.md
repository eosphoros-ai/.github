We are a team of technology enthusiasts from internet companies and NLP graduate students who are passionate about open source projects. Our focus is on developing solutions that protect the privacy and security of databases and large language models. Our aim is to ensure that the abilities of these models remain absolutely private, secure, and under control. With our solutions, we guarantee that your data is 100% secure and free from the risk of any data breaches.

As we move towards an era of large models, we have personally witnessed the power of open source technology. We strongly believe that many technologies, including the abilities of large models, LLMOps-related frameworks, Text2SQL accuracy, etc., will become the infrastructure of the new era. Through our open source organization, we strive to contribute to the development of this new era.
